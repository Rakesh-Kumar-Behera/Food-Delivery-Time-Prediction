# Food Delivery Time Prediction Model


**The food delivery time prediction model is essential in the food delivery industry, where timely and accurate deliveries are critical for customer satisfaction and overall experience.**

**To create an effective prediction model, we started by meticulously cleaning the dataset to eliminate errors and inconsistencies, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.**

**Next, we used feature engineering to derive valuable insights from the dataset. By considering factors such as the delivery person's age, ratings, location coordinates, and time-related variables, we aimed to identify key elements that affect delivery time. These engineered features enhanced the model's predictive power.**

**We then built the predictive model using regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness. We evaluated the model's accuracy with metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.**

**This food delivery time prediction model enables businesses to optimize their operations and enhance the overall delivery experience for their customers.**
